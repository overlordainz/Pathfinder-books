The demon lord has fallen, the forces of darkness were incapable of defending against the group of heroes prophesied to bring salvation to the world. But before the final blow was struck, the lord of shadows used the remainder of his powers to revive his generals and teleport them far from harm’s way. However, due to his weakening power, all he could bring were weaker, feeble versions of the ones that once made the earth tremble with their might. Now that the world’s balance has been tipped in favor of the light, monsters and creatures that once worked under the demon lord now find themselves aimlessly wandering his base of operations, bringing havoc to the followers of the demon lord as they attempt to wrestle control of the lands left behind.

The three generals now find themselves in the middle of a power struggle, awakening in a continent filled to the brim with monsters either devouring each other, or threatening to crown themselves as the new rulers of darkness.
