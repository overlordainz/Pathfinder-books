title="Sparveria"
+++
The dominion of Churki. Also of raptoroids and birds in general, although by no means are all of the birds sapient.
Most humans look at the giant birds nesting in the mountains as &ldquo;AAAaAAaa! Giant evil bird!&rdquo;, around here
they look at it as some combination of &ldquo;lunch&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweet ride&rdquo;.
But that's ultimately not what the region is known for, even if they do cook a mean omelette.

## History
Sparveria was founded by a gaggle (flock?) of the Lord Of Shadow's support troops.
Not so hot at infantry combat, these folks specialised in metalworking and construction: the gear for the legions of
terror doesn't come from nowhere, nor do their forts and watchtowers of ominousness, let alone the earthworks used on
the battlefield; all this fell under the engineering corps in some way or another.

As the empire collapsed, the bulk of personnel found themselves abandoned by the higher echelons, the chain of command
becoming unchained: every site for itself.
One of these happened to contain then Warrant Commodore Churki; an engineer with charge over the making of foundry tools
and the crafting of the unregarded gear that makes barracks livable at better than a common pre-industrial peasant's level.
As a warrant officer, his main job wasn't command, but with order dissolving around him, he had a choice: seize control,
be killed during a power grab, or deserting solo.

He'd be little more than a highwayman or at best blacksmith's gofer if he deserted, and of course being used to stuff
pillows hardly appeals, so seizing power it was, by sneaking in and mauling the depot's ranking officers in their beds
(and in one case, a kitchen), then daring anyone else to contest it.
Nobody did, in the face of sheer force of squawk, and since the depot was in a *terrible* location, badlands close to
goodlands close to a troublesome town,
not to mention easily beseiged with the combat troops gone,
Churki ordered the creation of covered wagons to find a new home.
Those are, after all, the proper vehicle to use on such a mission.

## Geography
By land area, a significant chunk of Sparveria is highly mountainous, mostly cliffs, rocks, and thin layers of grass on
the flatter bits.
The actual horizontal-ish land is largely glacial valleys of varying sizes, some old enough to be covered in forest.
Usable land is thus at something of a premium, encouraging cliffside, treetop, and cave construction.

As a consequence, the sophont geography of the region is more interesting: terracing increases the usable area,
while buildings that *can* be dug into or bolted onto cliffs often *are*.
It's a tradeoff, the building or entire town can't be centred in the farmland, but doesn't occupy any of it,
and the verticality this encourages is something that avian and avian-adjacent beings are comfortable with.

The local industry takes two prongs; somewhat-experimental giant bird husbandry, and metalworking.
The latter is the main source of exports and cause of imports, encouraged by leadership who were and are engineers.
